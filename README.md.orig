=======
- [X] Somehow scans the process to see if its running if not then notify
  - Function completed
  - Need Implementation via Telegram
- [X] If user requests a specfic commands shut down the pc
- [X] Notification works without the user having to show the screen.
  - Rather than having to show the screen, Python will open it up regardless if its minimized.
    - Potentially a way to make it go back to minimized.
- [X] Set time when it scans (possible user input)
  - Note that its manually inputed through Python console, will implement where you can do it via telegram
>>>>>>> development
- [ ] Graphical interface and a way for user to input their telegram api
- [ ] Deploy it on heroku

**Please note that it only works when the game is visible to the screen. In addition, credentials.py will not be provided dude to privacy,
but if you do intend to replicate the code you can replace token with your own API key.**
