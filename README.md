For a game called Black Desert Online, Checks to see if the weight icon limit appears, and sends a message through telegram to notify the users. Just a fun tool to play around with.





To Do list  
- [ ] Add a function that notifies through telegram that players has stopped cooking
- [ ] Somehow scans the process to see if its running if not then notify
- [x] If user requests a specfic commands shut down the pc
  -  Command is "/shutdown" Also allows user to verify if that is what they intended to do.
- [ ] Notification works without the user having to show the screen.
- [ ] Set time when it scans (possible user input)
- [ ] Graphical interface and a way for user to input their telegram api
- [ ] Deploy it on heroku

**Please note that it only works when the game is visible to the screen. In addition, credentials.py will not be provided dude to privacy,
but if you do intend to replicate the code you can replace token with your own API key.**
